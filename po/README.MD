# *ATTENTION*

### The 5 "$<nuber>, " strings SHOULD NOT BE TRANSLATED NORMALY

The following 5 strings represent the localized way of
how an address is represented in the language you are
translating to. You should surround all the fields with the
appropriate typicalities, and sort them appropriatety. 
For example, "$0, " translates to Japanese as "ã€’$3 ",
because, instead of the street name comming first, the
zip code comes first.

You may also leave fields empty, if the language you
are translating to cannot communicate these
information in an address, although *it's strongly
discouraged.*

### FIELDS:
- $0: street
- $1: city
- $2: state
- $3: zip/postal code
- $4: country
